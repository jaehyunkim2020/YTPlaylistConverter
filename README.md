# YTPlaylistConverter
a Python script that downloads and converts YouTube playlist videos into MP3 files


## Introduction

This script allows users to download videos from a YouTube playlist and convert them into MP3 format. It's designed to be easy to use, providing a command-line interface for efficient processing.

I have always enjoyed having the music files directly in my phone instead of using services like YouTube Music or Spotify due to the ads and subscription fees which was something I didn't want to pay for as a broke college student.

## Limitations (for now ðŸ™‚)

- The script cannot retrieve metadata to include artists name to the file name.
- The script cannot clean the file name to get rid of unnecessary characters (e.g. if the video title has something like "(Official Audio)")

## Future Features

1. GUI to make the program user-friendly to those who aren't familiar with using the command line
2. Also script Spotify playlists
